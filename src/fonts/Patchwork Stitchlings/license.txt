Coloring underlay instructions:
This font comes with a "color underlay" supporting font, for those who wish to quickly color "inside" the font.
To use this coloring technique correctly, please ensure both fonts are installed...
and lay down your text first with the "Patchwork Stitchlings Color" font...
and then lay down another font layer above that, positioned exactly the same, using "Patchwork Stitchlings".

Both fonts can also be used independently of each other.
See the promo image for various uses.
Have fun!
